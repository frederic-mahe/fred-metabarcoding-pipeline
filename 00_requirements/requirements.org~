* Requirements and dependencies

You will need to install vsearch, cutadapt and swarm.

You will also need python 2.7 (not tested with python 3) and a recent version of bash. MacOS users beware, Apple's Terminal provides an old version of bash (version 3). I'll try not to use bash version 4 specific code, but I might accidentally do it.
